    <p>The past and present wiltâ€”I have fill'd them, emptied them.<br>
      And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.</p>
    <p>Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?<br>
      Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,<br>
      (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)</p>
    <p>  Do I <span class="flicker-slow">contradict</span> myself?<br>
      Very well then I <span class="flicker-fast">contradict</span> myself,<br>
      (I am large, I contain <span style="color:red">m</span><span style="color:orangered">u</span><span style="color:orange">l</span><span style="color:yellow">t</span><span style="color:greenyellow">i</span><span style="color:green">t</span><span style="color:blue">u</span><span style="color:blueviolet">d</span><span style="color:indigo">e</span><span style="color:violet">s</span>.)</p>
    <p>  I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.</p>
    <p>  Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?<br>
      Who wishes to walk with me?</p>
   <p>  Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?</p>
