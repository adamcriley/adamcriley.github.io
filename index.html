      <div id="me" class="leftpic"></div>
      <p>I work at Thomson Reuters as a reference attorney consultant helping our customers to shape the practice of law by utilizing state of the art legal technologies to best represent their clients. When I'm not working directly with our customers, I’m passionate about enabling my colleagues to expand their possibilities and act more efficiently using low code tools and data science. I use my unique blend of education, experience, and boundless curiosity to build provide pixel-perfect, performant user-experiences that make every day easier.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind my screen, you'll find me with my dog - exploring the far corners and parks around the state, listening to audiobooks, and wishing that every adventure was off-leash.</p>

    <h2 id="apps">Applications built with my <span style="color:#27ffff">Team</span></h2>
    <p>My journey as a “low code” developer began with an inside joke about how often my team should wear sweater vests and has exploded into a suite of apps, power automate scripts, and tools that are used every day across the customer success organization and beyond. The platforms are built for rapid deployment allowing my team to be flexible and responsive in a way we have never been able to before.</p>
    <p>These projects have also given us the opportunity to include project members from across various roles and groups outside of the consultant team. We have been successful in integrating them into our agile-sprint framework and everyone has immediately contributed and made an impact alongside the core developers. We’ve received a lot of feedback and have been able to make improvements and earn the trust of our users.</p>

    <h3>Voice of the customer</h3>
    <p>The Voice of the Customer surfaces feedback recorded during front-line encounters with our customers. The comments are tagged with meta-data and shared across the organization. This project was a response to the decommissioning of the old sever and required a ground-up redesign of every aspect of the process. </p>

    <p>A script that aggregates my team's daily schedules and posts a warning when we need to make adjustments. This process was performed manually every day is one of many examples where we were able to take tedium away from a task without impacting the quality or usefulness.</p>

    <h3>Panda Chat</h3>
    <p>This is a lightweight program that allows users to download chat transcripts for quality review purposes. The data was originally difficult to access and we worked with the outside vendor to set up an SFTP server and then used Python to access and parse the data before reassembling and formatting it for readability.</p>

    <h3>The Mine</h3>
    <p>This App matches customer questions with powerful reference attorney searches, sharing them with our partners in training. This idea grew from the growing collection of data that was being accumulated by the Panda projects and my curiosity about the best way to leverage it. We settled on machine learning the data into content categories and allowing users to search across them for examples that could be used during customer trainings and demos.</p>
