      <p>When I'm not behind my screens or collaborating with my team, you'll find me with my family - exploring the far corners of some far off place, wishing every adventure was off-leash.</p>

    <h3>Voice of the Customer</h3>
    <p>The VoC shares feedback recorded during front-line encounters with stakeholders across the organization. The project began as a response to the decommissioning of the legacy system and required a ground-up redesign of every aspect of the process. We built a bespoke solution on top of existing enterprise softward with enhancements including global and fielded searching, automated alerts, and a back end automation that allowed for continuous data deployment.</p>

      <h3>Quick Check</h3>
      <p>After document upload, the team was seeing inconsistent and sometimes unexpected data. I reviewed the process and resolved underlying issues with several identified problems. This resulted in more consistent document processing across a wider variety of resolutions and formats. I built solid relationships quickly and my tenure was extended to help with customer research and a push launch several other Quick Check features.</p>

      <h3>Westlaw Precision Research</h3>
      <p>I am a core member of the team that launched Westlaw Precision, the latest evolution of legal research software, to great commercial and critical success. My contributions included driving changes to how the team approached data analytics, co-leading the quality control team, and collaborating with content and tech teams. My ability to understand and shape data, using tools like excel and python, single handedly kept several workstreams afloat, giving our partners opportunities to build out long term solutions without impacting timelines or budgets.</p>

    <h3>HarvardX Data Science</h3>
    <p>Organizations that lead with data-driven business decisions are an estimated 5% more productive and 6% more profitable than their competitors (hbr 2012). Product leaders must develop quantitative skills to drive data informed strategies. My project for this course was a deep dive into bias within the Carp-Manning US District Court Case Database; investigating different machine learning models and data storytelling approaches for legal content. Source code, details, and final report are available in my github repository.</p>
