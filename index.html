      <div id="me"></div>
      <p>I work at Thomson Reuters as a reference attorney consultant helping our customers to shape the practice of law by utilizing state of the art legal technologies to best represent thier clients. When I'm not working directly with our customers, Iâ€™m passionate about enabling my colleagues to expand their possibilities and act more efficiently using low code tools and data science. I use my unique blend of eduction, experience and boundless curiousity to build provide pixel-perfect, performant user-experiences that make a difference.</p>
      <p>When I'm not behind my screen, you'll find me with my dog exploring the far corners and parks around the state, listening to audiobooks, and wishing every park was off-leash.</p>

    <p>My journy as a low code developer began with an inside joke about how often to wear a sweatervest and has exploded into a suite of apps, power automate scripts and tools that are used every day across the customer success organization and beyond. The platforms are built for the rapid deployment of solutions which allows our team to be flexible and responsive in a way we have never been able to before.</p>
    <p>These projects have also give us the opportunity to include project members from across various roles and groups, integrating them into our agile-sprint framework to immediately contribute along side core members of the team.</p>
