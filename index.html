      <div id="me"></div>
      <p>I work at Thomson Reuters as a reference attorney consultant helping our customers to shape the practice of law by utilizing state of the art legal technologies to best represent their clients. When I'm not working directly with our customers, I’m passionate about enabling my colleagues to expand their possibilities and act more efficiently using low code tools and data science. I use my unique blend of education, experience, and boundless curiosity to build provide pixel-perfect, performant user-experiences that make every day easier.</p>
      <p>At the heart of everything, <b><i>I am passionate about solving problems.</i></b></p>
      <p>When I'm not behind my screen, you'll find me with my big dog - exploring forests and water in the far corners of someplace quite, wishing every adventure was off-leash.</p>

    <p>My journey as a 'low code' developer began with an inside joke about how often my team should wear sweater vests (the pinnacle of attorney fashion) and has exploded into a suite of Power Apps, Power Automate scripts, and tools that are used every day across the organization. The platforms are built for rapid deployment allowing my team to be flexible and responsive in a way we have never been able to before, creating agile solutions on the fly.</p>
    <p>These projects have also given us the opportunity to include project members from across various roles and groups outside of the consultant team. We have been successful in integrating them into our agile-sprint framework and everyone has immediately contributed and made an impact alongside the core developers. We’ve received a lot of feedback and have been able to make improvements and earn the trust of our users.</p>

    <h3>Voice of the Customer</h3>
    <p>The VoC surfaces feedback that is recorded during front-line encounters with our customers. The comments are tagged with meta-data and shared across the organization. This project was a response to the decommissioning of the old sever and required a ground-up redesign of every aspect of the process. While I'm proud of many different things I've contributed to this project, I'd like to share the process and decision making behind a recent change that resolved a growing instability problem in the app.</p>

    <h2 id="data-science">Exploring <span style="color:#27ffff"><br>&nbsp;Data Science</span></h2>
    <p>I have had a lifelong passion for answering questions; questions drove me through engineering school, then onto law school; eventually into a career where I enjoy getting to spend my days helping people find answers by digging through piles of legal data. Data science has helped me cultivate a set of tools around my problem-solving skills that allow me to act on my curiosity and find trends and solutions from the data that is floating all around us every day.</p>

    <p>Many examples of my analysis involve internal business information which cannot be posted here, but I would love to show you the process, motivation and analysis I used when completing two data science visualization projects for a data science certificate though HavardX. This includes a reccomendation engine using the Movielens dataset as well as a deep dive into the data from Carp-Manning U.S. District Court Case Database; details are in my github repository.</p>
